# Introduction to Deep Learning (Group Project â€“ 3 Members)

Used **PyTorch** on the **CICIDS2017** dataset to compare shallow and deep neural networks for intrusion detection.  
Applied dropout, batch normalization, and optimizer tuning to analyze model performance.

**Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas  
**Dataset:** CICIDS2017   
**Skills learned:** Neural network training, model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning
